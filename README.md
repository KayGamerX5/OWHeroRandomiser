# OWHeroRandomiser

Welcome to the Overwatch Hero Randomiser!

This is a very basic application that will allow you and any of your friends to be given a random hero to play.

Features of this tool:
  - Randomising heroes for 1-5 players. This function will allow you to enter the names of you and your friends and generate a random hero.
  - Randomising heroes with selected roles for 1-5 players. This function will allow you to lock the roles for *ALL* players currently being randomised, so that they will only get random heroes from within their respective roles.

Feel free to leave any feedback you have on this tool!

Thank you for using OWHeroRandomiser.
